		http://www.outguess.org/
- update gpgme-library
- understandable message if no matching private key found for decryption (no data error)
- investigate in adding a offline help system 
- strike out revoked keys in keylist and add warning to keydetails
- keyimport dialog should show reason for strike out
- key import should be more verbose: [DONE]
	- show message, which keys are imported [DONE]

	- if key is already in keyring
	- for now done just for import from file and clipboard
- show message, when key export is successful (statusbar)
- dropdown from menubar instead of dialog for file-cryption (files->encrypt,decrypt) 
- encrypt and sign, decrypt and verify (?)

BUGS:
- import key toolbar dropdown shows text, even if only icon should be shown

Release 0.3.3
- create revocation file on key generation
- optionally open new tab after encryption/decrytion 
- import from keyserver doesn't end, if network-connection is available, but no connection to keyserver  (?)
- Change private key password (catch bad passphrase message)
- set gpgme error language to chosen language (context.cpp:49)
- css
- key should blink short in keylist after import
- check and add missing statusbar messages
- set mainwindow-statusbar text via signal
- more doku on building gpg4usb (especially on windows)
- clear password-cache after quit (siehe kbasket)
- check pointer usage (const/references)
- add posibility to change password of key
- save the last used directory in open file dialog
- make keylist browsable with keyboard
- Change Keytable sorting: private keys should always be on top (partially solving "encrypt to self")
- clean header if quoted printable decoded
- PGP-MIME, find and show inline encrypted files
	- attachments-widget should be inlined in editor-tabs
- Settings-Dialog:
	- add tab for editor options, like font-size, line-break, tab-width, line-numbers,..
- remember Password:
	- checkbox in password dialog to remember password
	- Timer to remember password for x minutes?
- attachments:
	- context menu for files left in attachment dir-icon: clean attachments-dir
	- settings option "check attachment-dir all 10s and warn user"
	- remind user on closing if files left in attachments-dir
	- attachments dir as default option for "save"
	- clean attachments when:
		- opening new file in editor
		- decrypting
		- encrypting
	- status-tip "saved file" when saving file for "open with" [DONE]

Release 0.4
- save state on closing as encrypted file, allow recovery with password on next start
	- generate functional key for user
- investigate using libqgpgme1 (qt binding for gpgme)

Later:
- more internationalisation:
  - menu entry for changing character encoding
  - hints (on webpage?) which webmailer sends which encoding-header

- Drag and drop capabilities. Especially to encrypt / decrypt text, but would also be nice for files as well as import public and private keys.

- add a message-box with warning if someone's adding a secret-key to usb-keyring
- sorting keys would be nice (e.g. a-z or complete manual)
- Policy ( dialogs, what's warning, what an error )

- some kind of locking for keydb, as gpg.conf uses lock-never, for ability to run on usb-drives (fat-formatted)

- make use of GPGME IO-Callbacks from QT, read chapter 7.8.2 from GPGME info page

BUGS
----
- cancel decryption on windows hangs programm -> possibly bug in gpgme
- entering wrong password for decrypt on windows hangs program -> possible bug in gpgme
- Sometimes two or more stars are added to title of modified tabs
