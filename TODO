Release 0.2.2.1
- add translation for french
- beautify view menu

Release 0.2.3
- more doku on building gpg4usb (especially on windows)
- File-Encryption: Warning if file overwritten
- more internationalisation:
  - minimal MIME support (understand and decode "Content-Encoding" header, e.g. "quoted printable") 
  - menu entry for changing character encoding
  - configuration framework, for saving language & charencoding preferences
  - hints (on webpage?) which webmailer sends which encoding-header

Release 0.3
- adding signing and verifying
- nice for verify: import key from keyserver
- PGP-MIME, find and show inline encrypted files
- Qt 4.6 

Later:
- Add QSettings for persistent configuration
- Encrypt to self
- Drag and drop capabilities. Especially to encrypt / decrypt text, but would also be nice for files as well as import public and private keys.
- Password caching options (always, for X minutes, never)

- add a message-box with warning if someone's adding a secret-key to usb-keyring
- sorting keys would be nice (e.g. a-z or complete manual)
- Policy ( dialogs, what's warning, what an error )
- on windows an empty directory gnupg in application-data is created, find out how to disable
- Open File from command Line 
- Tabbed editor (including useful things like encrypted data opens in new tab)

- some kind of locking for keydb, as gpg.conf uses lock-never, for ability to run on usb-drives (fat-formatted)

usability:
- dialog on closing unsaved document (discard/cancel/save) is not very user-friendly
- undo / history

advanced:
- threading & thread-safety in context.cpp (in, out, ctx)
