Release 0.2.6
- more doku on building gpg4usb (especially on windows)
- remember Password:
	- checkbox in password dialog to remember password
	- Timer to remember password for x minutes?
attachments:
	- context menu for files left in attachment dir-icon: clean attachments-dir
	- remind user on closing if files left in attachments-dir
	- attachments dir as default option for "save"
	- clean attachments when:
		- opening new file in editor

		- encrypting
	- status-tip "saved file" when saving file for "open with"
- reorganise settings-dialog, have different tabs for simple, advanced and experimantal options
- update gpgme-library
- clean header if quoted printable decoded


Release 0.3
- PGP-MIME, find and show inline encrypted files
- Change Keytable sorting: private keys should always be on top (partially solving "encrypt to self")
- check pointer usage (const/references)
- check class / includes
- setup crosscompile-environment for building against glibc2.3 
- Qt 4.6 / new gpg-binaries / new gpgme libs

Release 0.4
- adding signing and verifying
- nice for verify: import key from keyserver

Later:

- more internationalisation:
  - menu entry for changing character encoding
  - configuration framework, for saving language & charencoding preferences
  - hints (on webpage?) which webmailer sends which encoding-header

- Drag and drop capabilities. Especially to encrypt / decrypt text, but would also be nice for files as well as import public and private keys.
- Password caching options (always, for X minutes, never)

- add a message-box with warning if someone's adding a secret-key to usb-keyring
- sorting keys would be nice (e.g. a-z or complete manual)
- Policy ( dialogs, what's warning, what an error )
- Tabbed editor (including useful things like encrypted data opens in new tab)

- some kind of locking for keydb, as gpg.conf uses lock-never, for ability to run on usb-drives (fat-formatted)

- make use of GPGME IO-Callbacks from QT, read chapter 7.8.2 from GPGME info page

usability:
- dialog on closing unsaved document (discard/cancel/save) is not very user-friendly
- undo / history
