Release 0.3.2
- Change private key password (catch bad passphrase message)
- Wizard on first start (Create Key, Import from older gpg4usb, import from gnupg)
- css
- key should blink short in keylist after import
- check and add missing statusbar messages
- set mainwindow-statusbar text via signal
- more doku on building gpg4usb (especially on windows)
- clear cache nach Programmende (siehe kbasket)
- check pointer usage (const/references)
- add posibility to change password of key
- save the last used directory in open file dialog
- make keylist browsable with keyboard
- update gpgme-library
- Change Keytable sorting: private keys should always be on top (partially solving "encrypt to self")
- clean header if quoted printable decoded
- PGP-MIME, find and show inline encrypted files
	- attachments-widget should be inlined in editor-tabs

		- opening new file in editor
		- decrypting
		- encrypting
	- status-tip "saved file" when saving file for "open with" [DONE]
Release 0.4
- adding signing and verifying
- nice for verify: import key from keyserver
- refactoring and cleanup:
	- gpgwin.cpp -> mainwindow.cpp
	- context.cpp -> gpgcontext.cpp
- save state on closing as encrypted file, allow recovery with password on next star
	- generate functional key for user

Later:

- more internationalisation:
  - menu entry for changing character encoding
  - hints (on webpage?) which webmailer sends which encoding-header

- Drag and drop capabilities. Especially to encrypt / decrypt text, but would also be nice for files as well as import public and private keys.

- add a message-box with warning if someone's adding a secret-key to usb-keyring
- sorting keys would be nice (e.g. a-z or complete manual)
- Policy ( dialogs, what's warning, what an error )
- Tabbed editor (including useful things like encrypted data opens in new tab)

- some kind of locking for keydb, as gpg.conf uses lock-never, for ability to run on usb-drives (fat-formatted)

- make use of GPGME IO-Callbacks from QT, read chapter 7.8.2 from GPGME info page

usability:
- dialog on closing unsaved document (discard/cancel/save) is not very user-friendly
- undo / history

BUGS
----
- on windows an empty directory gnupg in application-data is created, find out how to disable
- cancel decryption on windows hangs programm -> possibly bug in gpgme
- entering wrong password for decrypt on windows hangs program -> possible bug in gpgme
