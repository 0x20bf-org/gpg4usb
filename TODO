Release 0.2
- move to Qt 4.5 (includes building static qt on win32 and linux, also write howto about static building) 
- KeyManagement (create/export) [DONE] 
- new thread for key creation, to keep gui responsive [DONE]
- progressbar on key creation [DONE]
- File En-/Decryption [DONE]

release 0.2.1
- private key export
- key properties dialog

Release 0.3
- adding signing and verifying
- nice for verify: import key from keyserver

Later:
- Add QSettings for persistent configuration
- Encrypt to self


- Binary File Attachements, function for Decrypt & Help-Text (like safe eml, etc)
- add a button to open Keytable ( now you have to restart, if accidently closed the keytable ).
- add a message-box with warning if someone's adding a secret-key to usb-keyring
- sorting keys would be nice (e.g. a-z or complete manual)
- Policy ( dialogs, what's warning, what an error )
- on windows an empty directory gnupg in application-data is created, find out
how to disable
- Open File from command Line 

- More Keymanagement (new popup window?) including:
    - export private key
    - import keyfiles in non ASCII-Amor-format (always and everywhere error-free keyimport would be great)
    - Import key from Keyserver

- Tabbed editor (including useful things like encrypted data opens in new tab)

- some kind of locking for keydb, as gpg.conf uses lock-never, for ability to run on usb-drives (fat-formatted)

usability:
- dialog on closing unsaved document (discard/cancel/save) is not very user-friendly

advanced:
- threading & thread-safety in context.cpp (in, out, ctx)

Use QStringList instead of QList<String>
